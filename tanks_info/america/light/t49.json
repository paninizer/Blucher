  "name": "T49",
  "description": "T49 was an attempt to upgun M41 Walker-Bulldog in order to stay relevant against more heavily armored tanks such as T-54 which appeared after the introduction of M41. To create T49, M41 was upgraded with a 90mm gun and a larger turret. This tank later served as the test bed for the 152mm M8E1 rifled gun/launcher. This tank was later adapted into the M551 Sheridan.",
