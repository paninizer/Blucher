  "name": "T71",
  "description": "Experimental airborne light tank with an oscillating turret and automatic loading. Developed by Detroit Arsenal and Cadillacs from 1952 through 1953 as a replacement for M41. The armament was deemed ineffective, and the development was stopped after one wooden prototype had been built.\n\nThe T71 was a project from 1952 intended to replace the M41 Walker Bulldog. By 1953, there were several different prospective designs that could replace the M41 made by different companies – Detroit Arsenal, Cadillac, and AAI Corporation.\nCadillac’s design was one which did not seem to get very far off the ground at all. It was a more sensible and traditional design than Detroit’s. It featured the T185 gun, essentially the same 76mm M32 gun as the M41, but with a quick change tube. The vehicle was likely to be over 5.5 tons lighter, as it was estimated to weigh less than 18 tons. It had a crew of four – three in the turret (commander, gunner, loader), and a driver in the hull. It featured an AOI-628-I engine, with a fuel capacity of 150 gallons, with an estimated range of 150 miles.",
