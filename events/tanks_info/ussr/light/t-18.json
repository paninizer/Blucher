  "description": "The T-18 light tank (also called MS-1, Russian: малый сопровождения, первый, tr. maliy soprovozhdeniya, perviy, \"Small [Vehicle for] Support, First [type/example]\") was the first Soviet-designed tank. Produced from 1928 to 1931, it was based on the Renault FT, with the addition of a vertically sprung suspension.\n\nThe T-18 and its derivatives were essentially unsuccessful designs, but they gave Soviet industry its first experiences in designing armoured vehicles, and in the meantime a number of foreign tank designs were available for production.",
